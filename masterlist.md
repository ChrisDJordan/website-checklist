This is a checklist that the May 2015 UI Design class contributes to about all general HTML/CSS steps.


# HTML
- [ ] Remember to include a `meta` tag for UTF-8
- [ ] Add reset
- [ ] Use alt text attributes on images
- [ ] Indent nested elements
- [ ] name class values with names related to the content
- [ ] When using `display: inline-block' make sure to add comments to your HTML to close the small space between divs
